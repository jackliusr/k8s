= Documentation systems

There are serveral markdown documenation systems for software engineering availble in the street.  I tried latex, markdown, AsciiDoc. Latex is too complex and there is no decent render for web, Markdown is quite lax, so I settled down on AsciiDoc for this place on its following features.

In the day-to-day communications between me and my colleagues, I still use other format which we all feel comfortable with.

For project documentations, I prefer to Antora over Docsy. In Antora you can easily switch among many version beside other features.
