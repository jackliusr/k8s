== Prerequisites

Docker, kind, kinder, jq, yq, kustomize and helm are installed at your machine

== Usage


[source, bash]
----
#in wsl2 + docker, run following command before start docker service
sudo mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd
sudo mount -t cgroup -o none,name=systemd cgroup /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd
sudo service docker start
----

[source,bash]
----
./up.sh [cluster-name]
----

== Development

up.sh will call kind with the cluster configuration to create the cluster if there isn't kind clusters named kind. after the creation of the cluste, up.sh will call the corresponding hook script if it exists under ./configs folder.

=== naming convention

. [clust-name]-cluster.yaml: mandate
. [clust-name]-hook.sh:  optional
