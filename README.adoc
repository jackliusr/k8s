== Prerequisites

Docker, kind and helm are installed at your machine

== Usage

[source,bash]
----
./up.sh [cluster-name]
----

== Development

up.sh will call kind with the cluster configuration to create the cluster if there isn't kind clusters named kind. after the creation of the cluste, up.sh will call the corresponding hook script if it exists under ./configs folder.

=== naming convention

. [clust-name]-cluster.yaml: mandate
. [clust-name]-hook.sh:  optional
