[CAUTION]
====
Calico networking cannot currently be installed on the EKS control plane nodes. 
As a result the control plane nodes will not be able to initiate network connections to Calico pods.
(This is a general limitation of EKSâ€™s custom networking support, not specific to Calico.) As a workaround, 
trusted pods that require control plane nodes to connect to them, such as those implementing admission 
controller webhooks, can include hostNetwork:true in their pod spec. 
See the Kuberentes API pod spec definition for more information on this setting.
